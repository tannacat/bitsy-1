# Testing Bitsy!
_Made a stupid little game! If I had all the time in the world I would take more care and consideration with storytelling and interactions, but this time was a little mess around. I found it oddly theraputic and fun.... though I don't think I'll use it for 
my desired end piece, it is the most fun i've had in a while, and maybe I'll test it out in the future more!_
